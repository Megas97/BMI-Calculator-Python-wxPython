A simple Python program which tells you your Body Mass Index (BMI) when you input your height and weight. It also gives an error in the GUI when there is division by 0 if you enter 0 as your height (or forget to enter your own value for it). The different conditions are written to the right for easy referencing. It also has a black theme to be easier on the eyes as well as a close button to exit the application. You can see the formula used to calculate your BMI at the top below the instructions text. Position is absolute, not relative so don't resize the window as the elements won't move accordingly. And finally, this is my very first program with any kind of GUI so go easy on me if you have some critical stuff to say :)
